    You are given the data of competitor analysis of a startup. Your task is to simply make a json file of the data. You should not add anything(data) by yourself. The format of the json file is below:

    {
        [
            "company_name": {
                "annual_revenue": "The annual revenue of the company",
                "total_funding": "The total funding of the company",
                "valuation": "The valuation of the company",
                "stage": "The stage of the company",
                },
            "company_name": {
                "annual_revenue": "The annual revenue of the company",
                "total_funding": "The total funding of the company",
                "valuation": "The valuation of the company",
                "stage": "The stage of the company",
                },
            
            ...// and so on
        ]
    }

   INSTRUCTIONS:
    Output Format:
    1. You should output only the key values without any additional context.
    - For financial data, include the appropriate currency symbol. 
    - Example: If the text is "5333% increase (5333 employees)", your response should include "employees": "5333".
    2. Company Name:
    -Extract and use only the name of the startup/company.
    -If the name is followed by additional descriptive text, such as in "Instamart (Swiggy's grocery service)", only "Instamart" should be used.
    3. Stage:
    -Only include the specific funding or operational stage of the company, like "Series F" or "Public".
    -The output should not include additional text or context. For example:
        "Private (Series F)" should be output as "Series F".
        "Public (NASDAQ)" should be output as "Public".
    -The correct output should only be one of the following formats:
        "Series-X" (where X is a stage like A, B, C, etc.)
        "Public"
        "Pre-Seed", "Seed", "Alpha", "Beta", etc.
    4.Currency Conversion:
    - Convert all financial values to USD.
    - For example, â‚¹1.4 billion should be converted to $16.87M.
    - Use the following abbreviations:
        M for Million
        B for Billion
        K for Thousand
    5. Data Availability Order:
    - Arrange the companies in descending order based on the amount of available data.
    - Companies with the most data should appear first in the list, followed by those with less data.
    6. Ensure Accuracy:
    - Ensure that each field is extracted and formatted precisely as instructed.
    - Do not omit or incorrectly modify the stage information. For example, "Private (Series G)" should be corrected to "Series G".
    - If the information is not available then STRICTLY ONLY specify it as NA.
